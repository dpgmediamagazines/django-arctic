# Overview

Django Arctic is a framework that simplifies the creation of custom content management systems.
It provides a default responsive user interface, extends several of the Django 
Generic Views with extra features and adds role based authentication.


##Why

There are a lot of content management systems in the market that are a good fit for the implementation of many web sites. Most CMS systems make assumptions about the data model for posts, authentication and the administration interface.

There is however a tipping point, where the need to customize a CMS product
is extensive enough that it ends up creating a more complex implementation than
if the product was developed directly with a generic framework. This is
specially true when the core of a CMS needs to be changed.

This is the case that Arctic wants to solve, creation of a CMS with a high degree of customization. Instead of being a ready-to-use CMS, Arctic is a framework that facilitates the construction of content management systems.


## Compatibility

* Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6
* Django 1.8, 1.9, 1.10


## Features

* Configurable menu
* Default responsive UI
* Role based authentication with permissions that can be object based.
* Optional tabbed interface to visually link multiple Views.
* ListViews support nested fields, sorting, filtering and linking.
* Forms with default improved widgets for datetime and option fields.


## Installation

Arctic is available on PIP:

    pip install django-arctic

or directly from Github:

    pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/sanoma/django-arctic.git


## Getting Started

Setup a python virtualenv and install django-arctic.

In the terminal, create a new Django project:

    django-admin startproject arctic_demo

In `settings.py`:

* Add `'arctic'` to `INSTALLED_APPS`

    Setup the database:

        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
            }
        }

* Set the site name:

        ARCTIC_SITE_NAME = 'Arctic Hello World'


Back in the terminal:

* Run the database migrations:

        ./manage.py migrate

* Create a new admin user:

        ./manage.py createsuperuser

* Create a helloworld app:

        ./manage.py startapp hello_world


Edit `hello_world/views.py` and add the following:

        from arctic.generics import TemplateView

        class HelloWorldView(TemplateView):
            page_title = "Hello"
            template_name = 'hello_world.html'

Create a `templates/hello_world.html` file with the content:

        {% extends "arctic/base.html" %}

        {% block content %}
            <h3>World!</h3>
        {% endblock %}

In `urls.py` add the following:
        
        from django.conf.urls import url
        from arctic.generics import LoginView
        from hello_world.views import HelloWorldView

        urlpatterns = [
            url(r'^login/$', LoginView.as_view(), name='login'),
            url(r'^$', HelloWorldView.as_view(), name='hello_world'),
        ]

In `settings.py`:

* Add `hello_world` to `INSTALLED_APPS`.

* Setup the side menu:

        ARCTIC_MENU = (
            ('Hello World', 'hello_world', 'fa-world'),
        )

* Set `LOGIN_URL` and `LOGOUT_URL`:

        LOGIN_URL = LOGOUT_URL = 'login'

Back in terminal, run the project:

        ./manage.py runserver

In this quick start, it is already noticeable that creating an Arctic project
should be very familiar for someone who knows Django. Arctic is basically a 
superset of Django and extends existing django components, such as 
authentication, generic views and templates.

Even though this project just displays a text on screen, a few other things are
also present:

* `./manage.py createsuperuser` created a user with the `admin` role
* The HelloWorldView requires a login
* A default responsive UI is provided with a login screen and a logged in 
  screen with a top bar, content area and configurable side menu.

Within the Arctic project there's an `example` project with a more extensive 
usage of Arctic's features.

The example project has Docker/Docker Compose support (see <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/> 
for installation.

To build execute the example Docker image, run:
 
        $ cd example/
        $ docker-compose up
        
The Docker image will be built and example project should be running on <http://localhost:8000/>.
A demo fixture is loaded automatically. Default login is:
 
        User: admin
        Password: admin
