Django Arctic is a framework that speeds up the creation of custom content 
management systems.
It provides a Bootstrap 4 based user interface, role based authentication and
a number of generic Django Views that provide great looking and feature-rich 
lists and forms.

- Lists support sorting, searching, links, nested fields, custom columns 
  and data sources not only from databases but also from APIs
- The Forms have enhanced widgets for DateTime, AutoComplete and MultiSelect 
  and also support custom layouts without having to create extra 
  templates.

## Why

There are a lot of content management systems in the market that are a good fit 
for the creation of many web sites.
Most CMS's make assumptions about the data model for posts, authentication and 
the administration interface.

There is however a tipping point, where customizing a CMS product
is so extensive that it ends up being better to use some lower level framework.

This is the case that Arctic wants to solve, creation of a CMS with a high 
degree of customization.
Instead of being a ready-to-use CMS, Arctic is a framework that facilitates the construction of content management systems.
